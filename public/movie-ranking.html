<h1> Mark's Favorite Movies </h1>
<h2> His top three picks </h2>
<hr />
<h3> The Shining </h3>
<p>
The original movie, The Shining, was directed by Stanley Kubrick.  Stephen King hated it.  It departed from the book in
significant ways but given the time constraints this may have been necessary.  Kubrick did a masterful job of capturing
the evil within the hotel and Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall gave masterful performances.

<h3> Breaker Morant </h3>
<p>
This movie is based on true events where three Australian soldiers in the British were used as scapegoats during the Boer War to help
England extricate herself from a guerilla warfare scenario, much like the US faced in Viet Nam.  Edward Woodward played
the main character whose nickname was Breaker Morant.  The movie captures the injustice Breaker and the two other
soldiers faced in a sham trial.

<h3> The Big Chill </h3>
<p>
This is a great movie about a group of friends that formed during their years at college and them regathering some years
later for a funeral when one of the group commits suicide.
